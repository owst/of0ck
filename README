Of0ck
=====

Here's a quick twist on the classic esoteric programming language Brainf*ck.

Of0ck uses modified input symbols:

oO == > Increment the pointer.
oo == < Decrement the pointer.
0O == + Increment the byte at the pointer.
0o == - Decrement the byte at the pointer.
Oo == . Output the byte at the pointer.
OO == , Input a byte and store it in the byte at the pointer.
O0 == [ Jump forward past the matching ] if the byte at the pointer is zero.
o0 == ] Jump backward to the matching [ unless the byte at the pointer is zero.

example.html allows for code input and execution, and BF->Of0ck conversion.
