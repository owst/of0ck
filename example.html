            Any lines beginning with * are treated as comments and all
            whitespace is insignificant.<br/>
            As an example, a program that reads its input, reverses it and
            prints to the output looks like: <code>OOO0oOOOo0ooO0Ooooo0</code>
            nice, eh? :)

            Got a BF program, but want to execute it using Of0ck? No problem:
            paste the BF into the field below, hit translate and equivalent
            Of0ck will appear!<br/>
            Translate BF to Of0ck: <textarea id="toTranslate"></textarea><br/>
